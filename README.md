# Marketing Campaign for Term Deposit 
This project is my first project on the application of machine learning. The publicly available bank dataset from **UCI Machine Learning Depository** is used. The three different classification methods such as logistic regression using lasso regularization, KNN using bias-variance trade-off and Naive Bayes method has been compared on the basis of 80:20 cross-validation procedure. According to the model performance criterion, logistic regression is found to be the best model.
